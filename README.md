## Overview

### The challenge

- Building out a landing page and get it looking as close to the the wireframe provided in png as possible
- The wireframe is in Desktop Design so has to be adapted to tablet
- This page has to be responsive for Mobile and Tablets
- Made it with Sass and using the pseudoclass nth-child to change some positions
- Made it with Bootsrap using the Components:
  - Accordion
  - Buttons
  - Card
  - Navbar
  - Navs & Tabs
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the newsletter form is submitted if:
  - The input field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
